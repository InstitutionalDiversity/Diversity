# The Diversity Lists

## What These Lists Are About
These lists are a curation of items about diversity, not a collection of everything about diversity.

## Submitting New Items

If you want your item to be included on  a diversity list , try to only include notable items/users/companies that are involved in diversity.

When you submit a  particular item for a list, you should also state why it should be on a list and how others will benefit from it.


## Respect Accept other people's opinion

This is a curated list, but we respect other people's opinion. If you are submitting a list and a lot of other users disagree with your decision on what should and should not be included in a list, maybe you should reconsider.
